However, it falls short by not mentioning the need for items to be free of common irritants like alcohol or fragrances. Additionally, while the response touches on the importance of cleanliness, it does not elaborate on the necessity of products being free of harmful ingredients or stress the significance of a chemical allergy test, which are important considerations for sensitive skin care. Furthermore, the response lacks the continuous improvement aspect highlighted in the reference answer, such as periodically evaluating the skin's reaction and adjusting the product selection accordingly. These omissions make the response less complete and useful than it could be. Therefore, despite being relevant and somewhat useful, the response does not fully meet the requirements of the score rubric. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
