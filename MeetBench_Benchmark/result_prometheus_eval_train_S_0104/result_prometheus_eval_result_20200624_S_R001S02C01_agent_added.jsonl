It presented a structured approach, which included offering creative courses for children and teenagers, providing training and consultation services for adults, leveraging social media for promotion, improving service quality, developing related products, and seeking investments or partnerships. However, it failed to address the unique needs of specific age groups, such as health and convenience considerations for the elderly demographic. Additionally, the strategies proposed were somewhat generic and lacked a deep analysis of the market's dynamics. Despite these shortcomings, the response did demonstrate a fundamental understanding of business expansion and the use of various platforms to increase brand awareness and customer engagement. The suggestions, while not exhaustive, could contribute to a company's growth in the right direction. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, the response was partially effective in addressing the question's requirements. \n[RESULT] 3", "score": 3}

However, there's an absence of explicit mention of the agreement with the tenth-anniversary event. The response successfully mentions the different methods of procurement for props, which demonstrates a good understanding of customer needs based on their budget. Additionally, the proposal to optimize photography through post-processing techniques is a useful tactic to enhance the impression on customers. However, the specifics on the improvement measures for enhancing the feeling of being in an extraordinary setting are not fully detailed, which slightly reduces the usefulness of the response. Nonetheless, the overall response adheres to the instructions and maintains relevance to the question. Therefore, while it covers most of the points asked for, it lacks the complete detail that would elevate it to a higher score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4", "score": 4}

This approach indicates a strong understanding of the nuances involved in targeted marketing. The suggestions to collaborate with famous IPs and to create personalized services demonstrate an appreciation for the diversity of target audiences. \n\nAdditionally, the recommendation to conduct offline activities directly engages potential customers in the experience, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the marketing campaign. Building an online community further aligns with contemporary marketing strategies that leverage social media to create engaging content. Finally, the advice to continually improve the user experience underscores the importance of ongoing optimization to maintain and attract new customers. \n\nThe only minor shortcoming is that it lacks specific details such as setting thematic activities based on the targeted age groups and leveraging influencers or KOLs, which could have added depth and clarity to the strategies. These missing elements, while minor, indicate room for improvement in fully capturing the marketing challenge at hand. \n\nIn conclusion, while the response is well-structured and largely comprehensive, there is room for slight enhancement to ensure a more complete and effective strategy. This is why the response scores a 4 instead of a 5, despite the many strong points it presents. \n[RESULT] 4", "score": 4}

It correctly addresses the need for accuracy and safety in the production of props using non-metal materials, as well as the importance of balancing cost with quality in the selection of makeup and decorative products. Additionally, it touches on the importance of appealing to different age groups through varied themes and interactions. However, the response falls slightly short in directly addressing the question's emphasis on avoiding the use of regulated weapons (manage sword risk), which is an important aspect of ensuring safety in prop production. Although it alludes to avoiding risks, it does not explicitly mention this. Therefore, while the response covers most bases, there is room for improvement in terms of fully aligning with the question's specific concerns regarding weapon risk avoidance.
