It correctly identifies the advantages of living in a school zone, specifically that it allows children to attend their desired schools directly. However, the response does not fully explain how this strategy would improve sales effectiveness and service quality. It simply recommends that more housing units be sought in the school zone area without offering specific strategies or methods to achieve this. While the response is accurate in content and adheres to the structure of the query, it lacks depth in explaining how the sales strategy can be improved.

{"question": "你好焦焦又看待如何看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题", "instruction": "你好焦焦又看待如何看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题", "reference_answer": "这种情况反映了开发商的不诚信行为，消费者应通过收集证据，向消费者保护组织投诉或通过法律途径追求自己的权益，同时提醒公众注意此类风险。", "assistant_answer": "在看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题上，我们需要理性对待。首先，我们要明确开发商有义务按照合同约定向我们提供优质的商品和服务；其次，我们应该保留好相关的合同和证据，以便在出现纠纷时能够有足够的法律依据来维护自己的权益；最后，如果开发商确实存在违约行为，我们可以通过法律途径来要求其承担相应的责任，同时也可以通过舆论监督等方式来促使其改正。", "feedback": "Your response acknowledges the importance of addressing the issue between the code review reward and the developer's actual performance. It appropriately suggests practical steps such as maintaining relevant contracts and documents, and resorting to legal action and public awareness if necessary. However, it lacks the emphasis on the reality of non-honorific behavior by the developer and the implication of this behavior for the user. While you advise maintaining proof of contract violations, the response does not convey the urgency of protecting consumer rights in these scenarios. Moreover, it falls short in suggesting actions that the user can take to mitigate the risk of similar future occurrences. This makes your response less comprehensive and informative than it could be. \n\nFurthermore, the response does not fully engage with the user's needs as indicated in the instruction. The instruction implies that the user is seeking guidance on how to appropriately react to situations where a developer fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. The user might be looking for advice on possible actions they can take to address the situation, not just the fact that it's important to protect their rights. In this sense, the response lacks specificity and could potentially leave the user without a clear direction. \n\nDespite these points, your response remains reasonably structured and largely accurate, with only minor gaps in completeness. It offers general advice that is relevant and might be useful to the user. The feedback offered here is meant to guide the user in understanding their options better and should not be interpreted as a condemnation of the quality of the response. \n\nSo, after considering the various dimensions of the score rubric, the overall score is 3. This is because the response generally aligns with the user's needs and contains few factual errors, despite missing key details and practical advice that would have made the response more valuable to the user. \n[RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
