However, there is a noticeable lack of depth and detail in comparison to the reference answer. While the response mentions creating a budget, forming a team, and understanding market demands, it does not expand on how to effectively execute these tasks or discuss the importance of flexibility in strategy. This indicates that the response falls short in terms of providing a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand.
