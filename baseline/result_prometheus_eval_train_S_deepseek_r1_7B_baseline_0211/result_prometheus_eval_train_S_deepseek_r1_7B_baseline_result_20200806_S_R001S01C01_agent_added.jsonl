However, it was quite brief and lacked a comprehensive coverage of the various forms of support and resources available, such as direct financial aid or market access benefits. Furthermore, while the response mentioned specific policies in different countries, it did not provide a clear or detailed explanation of how these policies function or their potential impact on entrepreneurs.

However, the response is somewhat vague and does not delve into the complexities involved, such as the financial implications of using in-house staff versus outsourcing, which were not mentioned.
