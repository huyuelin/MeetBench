你好,焦焦。中介费收取标准是什么?如何确保客户满意,并避免受搂,不撬客户?

Reference Answer:
中介费通常为成交金额的1%-3%。确保客户满意，透明公平地提供服务，明确收费标准，及时沟通，理解客户需求。避免受搂，不撬客户，建立良好声誉，提供专业服务，赢得客户信任。

Assistant Answer:
中介费通常按房产成交价的一定比例收取，合同中明确。确保客户满意需提供专业服务、透明信息；避免受搂可通过诚信经营、公平交易实现。

Feedback:
The response provided some correct information about the middlemen's fees being based on a percentage of the property's selling price and was slightly aligned with user needs. However, the answer was somewhat vague and lacked specificity, such as the exact fee percentage range. Furthermore, while the response mentioned providing professional services and transparent information, it did not explicitly mention timely communication or understanding the customer's needs, which are crucial for customer satisfaction. In terms of avoiding customer manipulation, the response suggested honesty and fairness in business operations, which is indeed important, but again, it failed to mention the significance of building a good reputation or trust to maintain integrity in the business. These are minor points, but in the context of a scoring rubric where every detail is significant, these omissions result in a less than optimal score. Thus, considering all these aspects, it can be concluded that while the response was generally accurate and related to the question, it could have been more detailed and encompassing of the full range of the user's query. 
[RESULT] 3

Score: 3

你好,焦焦,基于之前我们讨论的内容,关于中介费返还的问题,如果客户在租房后不久就要求退房,并且要求退还中介费,我们应该如何处理这种情况?是否应该坚持不退还中借费因为中借服务已经完成

Reference Answer:
如果因房屋产权不全导致客户不满要求退房，需要退还中介费以避免法律纠纷。确认房源合法性，确保房产证齐全，避免客户因此要求退款，引起不必要的风险和损失。

Assistant Answer:
如果客户在租房后不久要求退房并要求退还中介费，应视具体情况而定。如房源合法、合同条款明确，则不应退还中介费；若因房源问题引发纠纷，则需退还以避免法律风险。

Feedback:
In the given scenario, the response correctly identifies that the refund of the service fee depends on the specific circumstances. It points out that if the contract clearly states that the service fee is non-refundable, it cannot be refunded. However, the response also mentions the possibility of refunding the service fee if a dispute arises from issues with the rental property. This inclusion of potential disputes introduces a slightly ambiguous aspect to the response. While the response does mention both possible outcomes, it doesn't clearly state that the refund of the service fee is contingent on the nature of the dispute, which could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Furthermore, the response could have been more concise and to the point. In terms of user needs, the response adequately addresses the scenario presented, although it doesn't offer any additional insights or valuable information that might have made it more useful to the user. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, while the response is mostly accurate and relevant, it has some areas that could have been clearer and more detailed. The structure and presentation of the response are generally clear, but they could have been more refined to provide a more comprehensive answer. The response does, however, succeed in being somewhat simpler and more direct than the reference answer, which is a positive point. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4

Question: 你好,教教如何向客户准确介绍房产的五证齐全情况和周边设施。
Instruction:
你好,教教如何向客户准确介绍房产的五证齐全情况和周边设施。

Reference Answer:
你好，介绍房产五证齐全时，明确指出拥有土地使用证、建设用地规划许可证、建筑工程规划许可证、房屋所有权证和预售房屋许可证。周边设施介绍包括交通便利性、教育资源（如学校）、医疗设施（如医院）、购物中心和娱乐设施等，强调其对生活便利性的提升。简洁明了地展示这些信息，帮助客户快速了解房产价值。

Assistant Answer:
五证指土地使用权证、建设用地规划许可证、建设工程规划许可证、建筑工程施工许可证、商品房销售(预售)许可证。介绍时强调证件名称与项目配套，如：“该项目五证齐全，含土地使用证、建设规划等，确保合法合规；周边有学校、医院、商场等生活设施。”

Feedback:
The response correctly identifies the five types of certificates (use of land, planning permits, construction permits, building permits, sales permit) associated with introducing a housing project to customers. It also appropriately highlights the relevance of these certificates to the project's legality and compliance status. Furthermore, the mention of surrounding amenities like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers is in line with the customer's need for understanding the quality of life in the project area.

However, the response could have been more effective in addressing the user's request for an accurate introduction of the property's situation and surrounding facilities. While the content is factually correct, the structure is somewhat lacking in clarity and the emphasis on the importance of these aspects could be stronger. Additionally, while it mentions essential points, it does not provide the extra value that would set it apart as being particularly comprehensive or useful for the customer.

The language used in the response is quite straightforward, but some terms could be further simplified to increase accessibility for non-Chinese speakers, which is an important consideration given the diverse audience for such an introduction. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the user's needs and presents the required information, though there is room for improvement in terms of structuring and completeness.

In conclusion, the response is largely successful in fulfilling the user's request, but it could have done better in ensuring the information was conveyed with greater clarity and in offering additional valuable information. The main issues are structural and completeness, with room for enhancing the language's accessibility for non-Chinese speakers.

你好焦焦基于之前我们讨论的内容关于学区房的优势和特点你认为在当前市场环境下我们应该如何调整销售策略更好地推广学区房同时提高销售效率和服务质量呢请不吝点赞 订阅 转发 打赏支持明镜与点点栏目

Reference Answer:
在当前市场环境下，我们应该强化学区房的优势，特别是其能让孩子直接在目标学校就读的特点。同时，考虑到租房市场的需求，我们可以在学区房附近寻找更多房源，以实惠的租金吸引更多家庭，提高销售效率和服务质量。

Assistant Answer:
应调整策略，重点推广学区周边房源而非仅限学区房，利用其便利性和较低成本吸引客户。同时，加强房产五证及周边设施介绍，提升服务质量，确保客户满意。

Feedback:
The response offered suggests a strategy shift towards broadening the market for education-related housing. By recommending the promotion of properties within proximity to schools rather than solely focusing on school-affiliated dwellings, the answer attempts to leverage the advantages of location and potential cost savings. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of the five certificate system and the introduction of nearby facilities to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction. However, it fails to emphasize the distinct advantages of living in a school zone, such as direct school enrolment. This omission represents a deviation from the core benefits being sought to be highlighted, which slightly reduces the effectiveness of the response. Furthermore, the response is brief and lacks detailed suggestions or strategies that could have been included for a more comprehensive answer. Nonetheless, it does address the key concerns of sales efficiency and service quality. 

Considering the rubric, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of the requirements, and its content is relevant and mostly accurate. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the key features of the school district housing, which could have improved its effectiveness and relevance. The response also misses an opportunity to expand on the strategies suggested, thereby reducing its utility. Thus, while the response has some merit, it does not fully meet the criteria for higher scores. 

Overall, the response successfully outlines a different marketing approach and touches upon some aspects of service quality improvement. However, it falls short in fully capitalizing on the distinctive benefits of living in a school district and could have provided more in-depth strategies and information. 

So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3

你好焦焦又看待如何看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题

Reference Answer:
这种情况反映了开发商的不诚信行为，消费者应通过收集证据，向消费者保护组织投诉或通过法律途径追求自己的权益，同时提醒公众注意此类风险。

Assistant Answer:
开发商承诺的代看奖励未兑现，可要求开发商按约定履行或协商解决方案，必要时可通过法律途径维权。

Feedback:
The response demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem posed by the instruction, but it lacks depth and detail compared to the reference answer. The response advises the user to request performance according to the contract or to seek a resolution through negotiation or legal intervention. While it is technically correct and touches on the necessary steps, it does not mention the potential fraudulent behavior on the part of the developer or suggest actions like filing a complaint with consumer protection agencies. Additionally, it doesn't emphasize the importance of public awareness of such risks.

The response is simplistic and does not provide any additional valuable information beyond the most basic advice. Although it covers the main issue, it fails to explore all potential solutions and does not sufficiently communicate the urgency and seriousness of the situation. The response also does not discuss the possibility of the developer's actions being illegal, which could lead to further repercussions for the developer.

In terms of the score rubric, this response meets the requirements for a score of 3. It addresses the user's needs to some extent, offers a practical solution, and avoids factual inaccuracies or irrelevant content. However, it falls short in terms of thoroughness, detail, and provision of valuable extra information, as well as in clarity of expression and presentation.

So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3
