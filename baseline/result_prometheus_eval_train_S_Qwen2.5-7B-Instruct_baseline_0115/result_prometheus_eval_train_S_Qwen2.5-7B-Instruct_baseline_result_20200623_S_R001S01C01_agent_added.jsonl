It succinctly outlines the steps needed to achieve this balance: planning a budget, defining team roles, tracking market trends, and adjusting strategy as necessary. However, it lacks some specific details that would provide a more comprehensive guide, such as the importance of aligning the team's skills and goals, or addressing the need to communicate and delegate effectively within the team.
