It correctly identifies that inviting celebrity guests to participate in live broadcasts and charity events can leverage their fan bases for promotion. Activities such as preheating and raffles are mentioned to boost interest. However, it does not offer the depth of detail found in a score 5 response, such as the need for clarity in cooperation methods and a structured approach to ensure success. It also lacks mention of a potential product or service that could be involved, which would have been relevant given the context of using celebrity influence for commercial gains.

Additionally, there are a few sentences that could be refined to improve the clarity and efficiency of communication. Thus, while the response generally meets the user's needs and is factually correct, it lacks the depth and specificity that a score 5 response would have. \n[RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
