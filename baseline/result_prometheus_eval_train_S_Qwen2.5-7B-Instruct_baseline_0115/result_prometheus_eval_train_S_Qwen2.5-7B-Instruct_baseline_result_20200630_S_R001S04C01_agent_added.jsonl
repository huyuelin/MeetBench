While the proposed solutions might have their merits, they are not as thorough or comprehensive as those mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific actions that would be taken to implement these solutions, which detracts from the overall structure and completeness of the response. The solutions offered are also less developed in terms of how they address the specific needs outlined in the user's question. This suggests a lack of complete understanding of the user's need and a failure to address it fully.
