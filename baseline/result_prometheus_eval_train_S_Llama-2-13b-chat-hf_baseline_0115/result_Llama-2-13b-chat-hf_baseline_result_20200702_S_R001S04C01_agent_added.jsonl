However, the response did not directly address the core question of how to screen employees based on their performance and capabilities. Instead, it focused on general management practices. While these practices may indirectly contribute to employee selection, they do not provide a clear strategy for screening employees specifically for their suitability in the design department. Additionally, the response lacked the specificity and detail found in the reference answer, particularly in the areas of teamwork and adaptability to future projects. The response could have benefitted from including these aspects as well, to provide a more comprehensive answer to the question. Therefore, although the response was generally positive and relevant, it did not fully meet the user's need for a detailed, targeted approach to employee selection in the design department. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
