As a flower shop owner, I'd like to know how to improve my sales through activities and collaborations. Can you give me some suggestions?", "feedback": "The given response shows an understanding of the user's question, which is to improve the flower shop's sales through activities and collaborations.

It does not offer any details about the marketing strategies, recruitment progress, or staff training for the 7th of July event, which leaves the user without the necessary insights and support. The lack of detail, structure, and the failure to meet the user's needs for specific information are the primary reasons why the response is graded so low on the score rubric. \n[RESULT] 1", "score": 1}
