Avoid fragrances and dyes, which can irritate skin. Look for cups made from medical-grade silicone or latex, and choose a size that fits your body. Soft, flexible cups are more comfortable and less likely to cause leaks. Finally, wash and sterilize your mooncup regularly to keep it clean and hygienic. Happy period! 💕", "feedback": "The response provided some relevant information about choosing mooncups for sensitive skin, but it lacks a few key aspects of the score rubric. Firstly, it did not mention anything about avoiding alcohol or fragrances, which is crucial for sensitive skin care. Secondly, while it briefly mentioned using soft and flexible cups, it did not emphasize the importance of the cup material being free of additives that could be irritating to the skin. Furthermore, it did not address the necessity of regularly cleaning and sterilizing the mooncups, which is an essential part of maintaining their hygiene and extending their lifespan. The response also missed out on suggesting the user to evaluate their skin reaction to the products and to adjust their product selection accordingly. Lastly, the response could have been more organized and detailed in its advice to the user. It somewhat fulfills the user's needs but lacks depth and fails to provide comprehensive guidance. Thus, based on the scoring rubric, the response has some room for improvement. \n[RESULT] 2", "score": 2}
