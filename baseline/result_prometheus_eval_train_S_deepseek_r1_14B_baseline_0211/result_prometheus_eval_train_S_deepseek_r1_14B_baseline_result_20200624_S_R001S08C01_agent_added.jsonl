It touches upon the important points of balancing the number of students and maintaining a balanced distribution of ability levels within the classes. However, the response could be improved by including specific strategies like using performance in certain subjects to guide the division or adjusting the structure as student populations change. Furthermore, although the response mentions matching students with experienced teachers, it does not elaborate on how this would benefit the educational experience or contribute to class diversity. The structure of the response is clear, but the details provided could be more comprehensive to fully address the user's needs. In terms of providing additional valuable information, the response only skims the surface, which is a minor drawback compared to the depth of explanation expected in the reference answer. Overall, the response meets most criteria but could be enhanced with more specific details and a broader range of considerations, such as adapting to changes in student population. \n[RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
