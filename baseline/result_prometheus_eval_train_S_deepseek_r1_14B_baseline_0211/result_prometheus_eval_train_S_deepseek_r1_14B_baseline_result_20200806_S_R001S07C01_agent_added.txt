Feedback:
The response provided some accurate information about the middlemen's fees and customer satisfaction. However, it had several shortcomings that led to a lower score. While it did mention that fees are usually collected based on transaction size, the provided percentages were not accurate and were quite broad, potentially misleading users about typical rates. Additionally, although the response did outline strategies for ensuring customer satisfaction and avoiding complaints, these strategies were somewhat vague and lacked the detail necessary to be truly helpful to users. Furthermore, the structure of the response was not very clear, which could lead to misunderstandings. There were also omissions regarding the implications of a poor reputation on customer trust and the importance of being transparent in business dealings. These factors combined to make the response less effective in meeting the users' needs for clarity and detail. Therefore, according to the score rubric's criteria, the response had several flaws, resulting in a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3

Score: 3

你好,焦焦,基于之前我们讨论的内容,关于中介费返还的问题,如果客户在租房后不久就要求退房,并且要求退还中介费,我们应该如何处理这种情况?是否应该坚持不退还中借费因为中借服务已经完成

Reference Answer:
如果因房屋产权不全导致客户不满要求退房，需要退还中介费以避免法律纠纷。确认房源合法性，确保房产证齐全，避免客户因此要求退款，引起不必要的风险和损失。

Assistant Answer:
如果客户因个人原因要求退房，应视情况而定：若房屋手续齐全，中介服务已完成，则不应退还中介费；若房屋存在手续问题，需退还中介费以保障客户权益。

Feedback:
The response provided aligns with the user's query and gives a clear outline of what needs to be done when a client wants to withdraw from a property rental after signing up with a middleman service. The response correctly identifies the conditions under which the middleman's fee can be refunded. However, it lacks the mention of confirming the legal status of the property before any action, which is crucial to avoid potential legal complications. Additionally, the response could have offered a more detailed explanation on the consequences of not refunding the middleman's fee, particularly if the service was performed in full. This would have enhanced the completeness of the answer. Therefore, while the response is largely correct and directly addresses the user's question, it falls short of providing the full context of the situation and offering a complete guide to handle such scenarios. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4

Feedback:
This response effectively addresses the query regarding the introduction of the five certificates and surrounding facilities of a property. It is accurate, offering correct information about the five certificates, and it ensures the user's need to understand the legality and compliance status of the property is met. It maintains simplicity in its explanation, making it easily understandable by the user. The structure of the response is also clear and concise, with each point being well-organized and addressed directly. Additionally, the response completeness is satisfactory, covering the key points necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the property's situation. However, there could have been a more detailed explanation of the certificates and an additional emphasis on the benefits of the surrounding facilities. This slight lack of detail and contextualization might be what distinguishes a perfect score from a high one. Overall, this response provides a solid answer, but there is room for improvement in terms of providing more value-adding information and a slightly more in-depth and comprehensive approach to the topic. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4

Question: 你好焦焦又看待如何看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题
Instruction:
你好焦焦又看待如何看待开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符的问题

Reference Answer:
这种情况反映了开发商的不诚信行为，消费者应通过收集证据，向消费者保护组织投诉或通过法律途径追求自己的权益，同时提醒公众注意此类风险。

Assistant Answer:
开发商承诺的代看奖励与实际兑现不符，反映了诚信缺失和违约行为。购房者应要求明确书面合同，并保留相关证据，必要时可通过法律途径维权。

Feedback:
The response provided is correct and relevant to the issue of a developer not fulfilling their obligations as per the score rubric. It mentions the importance of clear contracts, the right to demand proof of the contract, and the legal option to enforce one's rights, all of which align well with the user's query. However, while the response is accurate, it lacks some depth and specificity. It does not offer additional valuable information, such as recommending public awareness or stressing the importance of evidence collection. This omission makes the response slightly less informative than the reference answer. Moreover, the response could have been more concise to improve its simplicity and avoid redundancy. In terms of structure, the response is straightforward but might benefit from a more impactful opening sentence to better emphasize the developer's responsibilities. Despite these minor drawbacks, the response remains useful and well-articulated, hence deserving a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4
