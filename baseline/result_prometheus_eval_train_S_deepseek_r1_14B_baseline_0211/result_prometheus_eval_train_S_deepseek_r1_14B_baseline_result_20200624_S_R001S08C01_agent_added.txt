你好,教教如何根据学生排名制定合理的分班制度。

Reference Answer:
首先，根据学生的总排名或者相关科目成绩，将学生分成不同等级的群体。然后，确保每个班级中各等级群体的比例大致相同，以保持班级间的综合实力平衡。可以考虑专长和兴趣分班，促进学生潜能的发展。同时，注意调整，以适应学生的变化和需求。

Assistant Answer:
根据学生排名制定分班制度时，应综合考虑学生能力分布、教师资源及班级规模。将高、中、低不同层次的学生合理分配到各班，并搭配经验丰富的教师，确保教育资源均衡。同时，注意保持班级人数均衡，避免过度竞争或差距过大。

Feedback:
The response successfully considers the distribution of student abilities, teacher resources, and class size when setting up a classroom structure. It touches upon the important points of balancing the number of students and maintaining a balanced distribution of ability levels within the classes. However, the response could be improved by including specific strategies like using performance in certain subjects to guide the division or adjusting the structure as student populations change. Furthermore, although the response mentions matching students with experienced teachers, it does not elaborate on how this would benefit the educational experience or contribute to class diversity. The structure of the response is clear, but the details provided could be more comprehensive to fully address the user's needs. In terms of providing additional valuable information, the response only skims the surface, which is a minor drawback compared to the depth of explanation expected in the reference answer. Overall, the response meets most criteria but could be enhanced with more specific details and a broader range of considerations, such as adapting to changes in student population. 
[RESULT] 3

Feedback:
Based on the score rubric, this response is rated as 1 because it fails to address key aspects of the instruction. Firstly, it lacks the necessary detail on the specific tag standard for selecting excellent students from three-year-old classes. It also does not provide the specific policies and incentives for the targeted students. Moreover, the response is too brief and fails to provide a clear and complete answer. While the answer is correct in the context of the instruction, its brevity and lack of detail result in it not fully satisfying the user's needs. Therefore, while the information is accurate, the response lacks the depth, clarity, and completeness required to meet the user's demands. This results in a less effective communication of the necessary details. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1
