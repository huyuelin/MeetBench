The given response does not provide any useful information, making it impossible for the user to gain a clear understanding of the topic. It is important to note that a score of 1 is associated with a lack of accuracy, failure to meet user needs, excessive complexity, unclear structure, and significant omissions. In this case, none of these aspects has been adequately addressed. There are no factual errors in the given response, but the complete absence of content results in a lack of relevance to the user's inquiry. Additionally, there is no simplification or effort to present the information in a way that could be easily understood. As a result, the response fails to meet any of the evaluation criteria. It is essential to provide an informative and relevant answer to users' questions, which this response does not do. Therefore, considering all these aspects, it can be concluded that the response is entirely unsuitable. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1

Feedback:
This response failed to meet the requirements of the task. It did not provide any information related to the introduction of property certificates or the description of surrounding facilities. This absence of pertinent details renders the response ineffective for user inquiry. Furthermore, the response did not demonstrate any factual correctness or alignment with user needs. It lacked simplification and clarity, making it hard for the user to grasp the necessary information. The structure of the response was unclear, and there was no attempt to organize the content in a manner that highlighted important points. In terms of completeness, the response failed to mention critical aspects of the property's introduction, such as land use certificate, building construction planning permit, property ownership certificate, and pre-sale housing license. Thus, the response did not fulfill the criteria outlined in the score rubric, nor did it provide any valuable or usable information to the user. Therefore, the response was deemed to be inadequate and did not meet the required standards. 
[RESULT] 1
