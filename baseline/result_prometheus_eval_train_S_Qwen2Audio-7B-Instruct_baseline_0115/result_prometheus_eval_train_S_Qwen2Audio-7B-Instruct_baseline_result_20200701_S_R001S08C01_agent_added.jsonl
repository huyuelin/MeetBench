It correctly emphasized the importance of verifying the legitimacy of the property through official certificates, suggesting careful consideration before making a purchase. However, it did not sufficiently detail the steps to be taken, nor did it specifically mention checking if the housing development is regulated by a national authority, which is a crucial step in the verification process. Moreover, the suggestion to consult a local housing land management agency or legal expert was provided in a less clear and direct manner than in the reference answer. Therefore, while the advice given was generally on point, the response lacked the depth and clarity found in a higher scoring response. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response would be evaluated as having \"relevant content, but there are some aspects that need improvement,\" such as more specific details, clearer structure, and better fulfillment of the user's needs. \n[RESULT] 4", "score": 4}

However, the response could have provided more in-depth guidance on how to approach the issue, such as suggesting legal measures or the involvement of a neutral third party to facilitate discussions and negotiations between the parties. Furthermore, it lacks mentioning the necessity for written agreements or judgments to support any decisions made regarding the division of shared property ownership.
