The user requested information about sales data of Huawei and Apple from last week. However, the response provides sales figures without any context or source information. This lack of detail and verification might mislead the user about the current situation.\n\nSecondly, the response doesn't address the user's needs in a comprehensive manner. While it does give a direct answer regarding which brand's sales were better, it fails to provide any context or analysis behind these figures. It doesn't explain why Huawei's sales were higher or any other sales-related insights that could be valuable to the user.\n\nThe third point highlights issues with simplicity and clarity. The response does not contain unnecessary or redundant information, which aligns with the rubric's requirement for simplicity. However, it lacks the thoroughness and depth that could have made the response more informative and helpful.\n\nIn terms of structure, the response is direct and to the point, with a clear conclusion. However, it lacks elaboration and fails to provide a deeper understanding of the situation, which could have enhanced its utility to the user.\n\nFinally, the response seems complete but falls short of a truly comprehensive answer. It doesn't provide additional relevant information that could have offered a more nuanced understanding of the topic at hand.\n\nOverall, while the response does provide a direct answer to the user's question, it fails to fulfill the criteria of providing a complete, accurate, and insightful response to the user's needs. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria for factual accuracy, user need fulfillment, simplicity, structure, and completeness, the response is given a score of 1. \n[RESULT] 1", "score": 1}

A more accurate description would be \"礼品发送\" as it implies the user may need to pay for the product they're getting a gift with. Despite these issues, the response is generally accurate and addresses the core question, albeit with a lack of thoroughness. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
