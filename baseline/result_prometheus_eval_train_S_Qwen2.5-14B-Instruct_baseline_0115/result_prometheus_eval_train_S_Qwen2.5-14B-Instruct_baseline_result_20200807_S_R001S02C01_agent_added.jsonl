It correctly mentioned using preservation agents, regular water changes, and pruning as methods to extend the flower's life. Similarly, it appropriately suggested optimizing product display, adding interactivity, and offering time-limited promotions as ways to enhance sales performance. However, the response lacked specifics and was not as structured or comprehensive as it could have been. It failed to mention precise actions such as removing bottom tissues, cutting at a specific angle, or avoiding direct sunlight. Additionally, the response did not delve into specific strategies for increasing audience engagement and interaction during live broadcasts, nor did it emphasize the importance of predicting content and offering tangible incentives. Thus, while the response covered the main aspects of both inquiries, it did so in a less detailed and less structured manner than ideal. As per the score rubric, this results in a moderate performance on the rubric's criteria for factual correctness, user need fulfillment, simplicity, structure, and completeness. The overall tone and style of the response are also lacking in terms of engagement and clarity compared to the reference answer. So, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3", "score": 3}
