However, it lacks the level of detail seen in the reference answer, which could affect its completeness. For instance, it suggests partnering with male celebrities for endorsement but doesn't elaborate on how to effectively utilize such partnerships. Also, it mentions promoting the product based on male skin characteristics and needs but doesn't specify how to tailor marketing strategies to address these needs. The suggestions for social media promotion and trial sample distribution are sound but could benefit from more specific recommendations, like which platforms to use or what kind of trial samples would appeal most to male users.
