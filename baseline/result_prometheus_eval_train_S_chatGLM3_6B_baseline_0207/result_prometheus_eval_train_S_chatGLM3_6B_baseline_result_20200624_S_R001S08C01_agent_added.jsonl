{"question": "你好,教教如何根据学生排名制定合理的分班制度。", "instruction": "你好,教教如何根据学生排名制定合理的分班制度。", "reference_answer": "首先，根据学生的总排名或者相关科目成绩，将学生分成不同等级的群体。然后，确保每个班级中各等级群体的比例大致相同，以保持班级间的综合实力平衡。可以考虑专长和兴趣分班，促进学生潜能的发展。同时，注意调整，以适应学生的变化和需求。", "assistant_answer": "您好，要制定合理的分班制度，首先需要了解学生的能力水平和学习进度，可以采用摸底考试等方式进行评估。然后根据评估结果将学生分为不同水平的学习小组，每个小组的成员能力和学习进度相似，以便于教师进行针对性的教学辅导。最后，教师可以根据每个学生的实际情况制定个性化的学习计划，以达到最佳的学习效果。", "feedback": "The response provided some valuable insights into how to formulate a reasonable student grading system. It begins with an accurate identification of the need to assess students' abilities and progress, and proposes a method to measure these through assessments. However, it falls short in fulfilling user needs as it doesn't specifically address the requirement for the division of students into classes, a key aspect of the user's query. Furthermore, while it touches upon the concept of individualized learning plans, it does not offer a systematic approach to class formation based on ability and progress, which is a crucial part of the student grading system. Therefore, although the response presents a coherent and generally correct understanding of the issue, its incompleteness and lack of a clear strategy for class formation limit its effectiveness. The lack of mention of maintaining a balance of academic and personal interests among students in forming classes also makes the response less effective. The simplicity and clarity of the response are commendable, but it does not fully grasp the complexity of the user's question and fails to provide a comprehensive solution. So the overall score is 3. \n[RESULT] 3", "score": 3}

It correctly identifies that the recruitment begins from the third year level and includes an invitation for students from nearby schools. It also appropriately recognizes the need to attract more outstanding students for the high school part, particularly from the middle school graduates.\n\nHowever, it lacks specificity regarding the recruitment standards and the detailed optimisation policies or incentives for the initial recruitment of the first thirty students and the subsequent enrollment of the students. This absence of specific information is a significant drawback of the response.\n\nThe language used is simple and straightforward, and the structure is generally clear. However, the response could have been improved by offering a more thorough and detailed explanation of the policies and incentives in question.\n\nIn conclusion, the response covers the basic elements of the recruitment plan but falls short in providing comprehensive information about the details of the policies and incentives.
