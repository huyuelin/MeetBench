Feedback:
The given response shows a general understanding of the question asked, focusing on improving a Taiwanese table tennis club. It provides relevant suggestions, such as enhancing player skills, offering quality services, creating a comfortable environment, organizing enjoyable activities, and promoting exchanges with other Taipei clubs. However, it lacks specificity in the ways to implement these improvements, missing out on details like upgrading equipment or increasing training programs. Additionally, the response could have further elaborated on how these suggested improvements would directly attract more customers, as this was a key part of the original query. Therefore, although the response contains useful information, it falls short in terms of specificity and the depth of its suggestions, leading to a less comprehensive answer than desired.

台球赛分四轮：1. 初选赛积分赛选出16强；2-4轮淘汰赛（16进8、8进4、争冠军）。确保观赏性和避免疲劳：限制比赛时间、增加紧张感和激烈度、决赛期间全程录像和电台直播。

请问您如何改善球室吸烟问题,并提升清洁工工作效率?

Reference Answer:
设立指定吸烟区，禁止在非指定区域吸烟，并通过宣传教育增强公众意识。引入高效空气净化器减少二手烟。对清洁工进行培训，使用高效清洁工具和方法，定期评估工作流程以优化效率。

Assistant Answer:
建议加强室内禁烟措施，提高清洁工清洁效率。可以设立吸烟区，同时实行定期打扫卫生。

Feedback:
The response correctly addresses the user's query regarding measures to mitigate smoking within a ballroom and improving the efficiency of cleaning staff. However, the details provided in the response are limited and lack some essential elements. For instance, while the response suggests setting up a smoking zone and implementing periodic cleaning, it does not provide a comprehensive plan to enhance the work efficiency of cleaning staff, such as training programs or use of efficient tools. Furthermore, the response does not elaborate on the enforcement of the smoke-free area. Also, it does not discuss educational initiatives to raise public awareness about the dangers of smoking in the ballroom. Hence, although the response is generally accurate and relevant, it lacks the depth and detail necessary to fully satisfy the user's needs and expectations. Thus, while the response is positive, it could benefit from additional specifics to make it more useful and complete.

你好！请问有什么我可以帮助你的？

Feedback:
The response is extremely brief and fails to address the core question raised by the user. It does not provide any information or suggestions regarding the design of a detailed plan to attract more sponsors and enhance the brand image and customer experience in the context of a tennis court. There is no attempt to follow the structure of the question, nor does it include any relevant details that would be of value to the user. This lack of substance and failure to meet the needs expressed by the user results in a very low score on the provided rubric.
